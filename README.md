# room-prototype
An early idea for an interactive level selector made for 'Beat! This Game' (check my organizations). Features first person perspective movement, basic physics, model of a room and some basic interactions.

It's very 'rough' looking because it was never touched by a 3D artist as we ended up cutting it out of the project to avoid bloat.

Unity version 2018.2.14f1

You can do whatever you like with the project.
